Today I learnt about the basic about Python, including:
Unique Syntax;
Multi-Paradigm;
Interpreted Language;
Garbage Collected Function;
Dynamically-Typed.

Also, the pros and cons, 
Pros:
A comprehensive standard library
Community driven language 
A huge tons of third party apps

Cons: 
Cause it's comprehended it may be too slow
Not safe so it's not being frequently showing up on web explorer or smartphones

My question: 
After learning all this stuffs, I still have no idea what this powerful language can do. 

Hopefully I can have my own answer about this really soon.
