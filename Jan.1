Today is my first day decided to learn a brand new programming language. 
As for so many experienced people in this field strongly recommend me to do notes kind of stuff(just like something I'm typing right now), I may open a new blog website just to keep everything on track.
Hopefully I could make myself proud in 2024, find out what I'm suitable best in job hunting is extremely harsh, so I thought why not improving myself instead.
I'm not a excellent student with shiny university names, my mother tongue is not English either, but still, the experience I had on apps(robotics), which made me want to become one of the devs.
I chose Python as my first language today.
