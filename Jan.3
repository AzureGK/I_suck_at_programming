Tried to install python, but failed to confirm my python3 version on mac because no matter how many times I type "Python" "Python -v", it didn't response correctly. 
Finally I got the answer: you need to type on "Python3" instead of "Python".

Installed python again, knowing how to enter REPL, using Print(), and how to exit REPL(by using Control + D on Mac). 
Knowing the whitespace(we should usually make 4 spaces, not to mix tabs and spaces), The zen of Python: "Readability Counts."
Importing standard library modules, like "Factorial(阶乘)", knowing how to use help system.
