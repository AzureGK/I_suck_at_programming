Today I learned about several important keywords about module, including dunder names, shebang, comments, the exact execution Python model. 
Top level statements will be executed when a module is imported.
use dunder name(__name__) to determine how a module is being used. 
if __name__ = __main__, our module will be importable and executable. 
sys.argv contains command line arguments.

Problems: renectly the class bacame more and more complicated. Although I spent time to do my research, and use my head to consider what is the real meaning of the codes on the blackboard, still it's not that familiar. 
This is really haunting me which I don't know if it is good or not, since I would like to write a code as smooth as my teacher does. 
May keep updating my doubt on this problem.
