After several days of learning, I started to doubt what I'm learning. 
I don't know what this will be used for, since there is no actual practise(At least recently).
This issue is a problem for me, but it may not a problem I think?

Today I learned about:
Python uses named references to objects.
Assignment attaches a name to an object.
The garbage collector removes objects with no references. 
id() returns a unique integer ID, showing this specified id(maybe a random number)
we can test if equivalence with ==
