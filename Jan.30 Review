From 01/01/2023, I started a program called "I_suck_at_programming", which is a plan that keep a track of my little study road on Python. 
The reason I want to do this because, as a foreigner finding a job suits my personal situation is just so damn hard. 
People in my region, Tokyo, they would like to require applicants to meat a condition that called "potential ability", which means it is not depends on how strong you are right now, is the you in the future weights. 
But, I started my jobhunting from September 2022. As for now it's a 4-month progress, my friends some was being accepted by Accenture, Deloitte, you name it, the world famous consultant companies. 
I kept asking myself, what would I want to do? 
The answer is quite easy, Consultant or would rather a SE? (I have no idea which type of engineer I want to be so I chose SE) 
I have quite a deep connection which my tutor and professors. Whenever I asked them the question about my career, Tharp would like to let me to try it out by myself. Just like the case that I'm having a internship right now, which requires me to get up 6:30 am in the morning, that I wouldn't like to do on my own, but still I give it a shot. 
I had experience on Marketing, thanks to my parents who cannot afford my university, gave me a chance to started it up my own business to try if I'm capable to pay it out. 
Damn, life is hard. 
After trying out Marketing, I believe I have some potential in this field, but, it's sincerely not my favorite field. From the bottom of my heart I just know it, I don't know why. 
That's why I started to learn Python on my own. I'm not study in an IT-related field, but after I saw so many automations, besides the fact that I like to talk with computers, including jail breaking, use other's JavaScript to do my own thing etc., which I truly think this is my sole favourite. 
But as you can see, I can keep it up a week, 10 days, but after 15 days, it's really hard to even keep up. 
The reason for this, I think it is the unclear goal for self-learning. 
I'm a type of person that was always being called a "Try-hard" guy, I will do all means necessary to meet a goal. In Racing games, I can win all most every time, in GTA5, people hates my sniping skills for always winning them, in reality, my language learning skills are way better than others in the same grade. 
But why, this time a kind of language that have no interest in studying? 
I'm using an app called "PluralSight", honest review, I don't think this is worth for self learning. 
I don't know what I should do, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know learning this can bring me some results. I doubted so hard. 
I could show million reasons, like the final tests, the vacation, I won't. 
I know I have spare time to learn something for real, but I can't 
Maybe it's a time to change. So I write a comment on myself, with pure honest, hoping I can change from today. 
The first thing I will change is: use my mother tongue Chinese to learn this. 
After using English to learn, I really confused with the definitions of the words I don't know, which leads to a another dimension of confusion. 
I've got many types of learning materials for free. Good luck for myself üëç
