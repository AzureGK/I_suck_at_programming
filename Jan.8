Today I learned: 
import and def bind names to objects.
type() reports the type of an object.
dir() introspects the attributes of an object.
We can access the name of a function or module with __name__.
Docstrings can be accessed through __doc__.
We can use len() to measure the length of a string. 
The repitition operator, *, repeats a string an integral number of times. (I'm not sure what it's mean actually)
